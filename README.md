# FindAndReplace
Find and replace multiple text strings in multiple files

For this code to work right, you need to make sure that there is a csv file in the root folder of findAndReplace.py names findAndReplace.csv.

This csv should have the following format without any header:
findString1,replaceString2
findString2,replaceString2
findString3,replaceString3
.
